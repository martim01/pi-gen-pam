<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The Lissajou plugin shows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve">Lissajous curve</a> on the left hand side and a pair of audio meters on the right.</p>
<p>The curve is generated by plotting the amplitude of each sample of the left channel on one axis against the ampltidude of the correspondong right channel sample.</p>

<h2>Routing</h2>

<p>The Routing option page allows the user to decide what channels are plotted on each axis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First the user needs to decide on the routing mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow - the channels plotted follow those routed to the audio output. In stereo mode Left will be on the X-axis and Right on the Y-axis.</li>
<li>Force - the user can decide what the X-axis and Y-axis are and these channels will also be routed to the audio output.</li>
<li>Indy - the user can decide what the X-axis and Y-axs are independant of the audio monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<p>The available channels are listeed below the X-axis and Y-axis labels. In Follow mode they be disabled. Note it is possible to choose the same channel for both axis.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p><img src="images/2819_display.JPG" border="0" alt="display" width="402" height="240" /></p>
<p>The display mode allows the user to change how the Lissajou curve is displayed.</p>
<ul>
<li>dB - before plotting the amplitude of the sample is converted to dBs</li>
<li>Linear - no conversion takes place before the amplitude of the sample is plotted</li>
<li>Auto Scale - the peak level of each chunk of audio is taken and each sample is compressed/expanded so that low level signals are as easy to see as high level signals.</li>
</ul>
<p>The label at the top right of the Lissajou meter shows the current display mode and also the amount of expansion of the audio in Auto scale mode.</p>
<p>The LvR/MvS Axis switch decides what the X-Y axis represent:</p>
<ul>
<li>LvR - X-axis is Left and Y-axis is Right.</li>
<li>MvS - the axis are rotated by 45 degrees so that X-axis represents Middle (L+R) and Y-axis Side (L-R). This is the standard view for a Lissajou meter.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Hide/Show Levels switch either hides or displays a PPM scale. PPM 4 is shown in blue.</p>
<h2>Meters</h2>
<p><img src="images/2819_meters.JPG" border="0" alt="meters" width="399" height="240" /></p>
<p>The meters option page allows the user to choose between the different meter types defined in ppmtypes.xml.</p>
