<p>The Levels test plugin shows the level range of the incoming audio. It is useful for testing for silence or glitches on lines.</p>
<p>There is a column for each channel of incoming audio. These columns show</p>
<ul>
<li>A meter showing the current level in blue and the range of the levels in grey</li>
<li>The current level in dBFS</li>
<li>The maximum level in dBFS</li>
<li>The minimum level in dBFS</li>
<li>The range in dB</li>
</ul>
<p>Pressing the Reset button will clear the meters and labels. </p>
<p>There are 3 monitor options</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monitor Level</span></p>
<p>Logs any change in the audio level. Useful for when you have solid tone (or silence) and want to capture any changes</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monitor Range</span></p>
<p>Logs whether the range of audio (difference between quietest sample and loudest sample) exceeds a set value. This can be set from the slide</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monitor Min,Max</span></p>
