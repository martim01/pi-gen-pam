    <p>The FFT plugin shows the frequency spectrum of the audio. The plugin
      performs a Fast Fourier transform of each incoming chunk of audio and
      displays the the result in a graph where the x-axis shows the frequency
      components of the audio and the y-axis the amplitude of each frequency in
      dBFS. At the bottom of the screen the labels with the blue background show
      in order:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The display options</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Graph</li>
        <li>Lines</li>
        <li>EQ</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The calcuation type</li>
      <ul>
        <li>FFT</li>
        <li>1/3 Octave</li>
        <li>Peak</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The audio routing</li>
      <li>The FFT windowing function</li>
      <li>The FFT overlap between audio chunks</li>
      <li>The resolution of the FFT</li>
      <li>The dominant frequency (the frequency with greatest amplitude)</li>
      <li>The amplitude of the dominant frequency.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Options</h1>
    <h2>Routing</h2>
    <p><img alt="fft_routing" src="images/2818_routing.JPG" height="240" width="401"
        border="0"></p>
    <p>The plugin shows the FFT for a single channel of audio. The Routing
      options page allows you to select which channel you wish to analyse.</p>
    <p>In stereo mode the user is also allowed to select</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Middle (L+R)</li>
      <li>Side (L-R)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The 3rd blue label shows the current routing.</p>
    <h2>Display</h2>
    <img src="images/fft_display.png" alt="" height="240" width="399" border="0">
    <p>The display page allows the user to change they way the FFT is plotted.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Graph - shows a continuous line from the lowest to highest frequency</li>
      <li>Lines - shows individual lines for each frequency</li>
      <li>EQ - shows purple non overlapping "EQ" bars.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The 1st blue label shows the current display mode.</p>
    <p>The user can also choose to plot the fft in white only or in colour
      depending on the frequency.</p>
    <h2>Window</h2>
    <p><img alt="fft_window" src="images/2818_window.JPG" height="240" width="398"
        border="0"></p>
    <p>When performing spectrum analysis of live audio the incoming audio must
      be split in to chunks of data and each individually analysised. This can
      cause "spectral leakage". Therefore a windowing function is usually
      applied to the chunks of audio to smooth the edges of each window. There
      are a number of different windowing functions available, all of which give
      slightly different characteristics to the resultant frequency response.
      See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function">here </a>
      for more information.</p>
    <p>The 4th blue label shows the current windowing function.</p>
    <h2>Type</h2>
    <p><img alt="fft_type" src="images/2818_type.JPG" height="240" width="400" border="0"></p>
    <p>There are currently three possible types of spectrum analysis that can be
      performed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>FFT - performs a fast fourier transform on the incoming audio and
        displays the resultant frequency/amplitude bins.</li>
      <li>1/3 Octave - performs a fast fourier transform on the incoming audio
        and then calculates the energy in 1/3 octave bands.</li>
      <li>Peaks - performs a fast fourier transform and then calculates the
        "peaks". This is done by looking at each frequency bin and only
        displaying those where the bin on either side is lower.</li>
    </ul>
    The 2nd blue label shows the type.<br>
    <h2>Overlap</h2>
    <p><img alt="fft_overlap" src="images/2818_overla.JPG" height="240" width="397"
        border="0"></p>
    <p>Another way of making the spectrum analysis more accurate when dealing
      with chunks of live audio is by overlapping each chunk of audio. This page
      allows the user to decide how much he wants this overlap to be.</p>
    <p>The 5th blue label shows the amount of overlap.</p>
    <h2>Bins</h2>
    <p><img alt="fft_bins" src="images/2818_bins.JPG" height="240" width="403" border="0"></p>
    <p>When performing an FFT on audio the result is split in to a number of
      "bins" each a certain frequency wide. The more bins that you use the
      narrower each bin and hence the better the frequency resolution. However
      more bins means that you need to read in more audio before you can perform
      the FFT and so the refresh rate is slower. This page allows the user to
      choose the frequency resolution he wants.</p>
    <p>The 6th blue label shows the current resolution.</p>
    <h2>Options</h2>
    <img src="images/fft_options.png" alt="" height="240" width="399" border="0">
    <p>From this page the user can freeze the display by pressing the Hold
      button and enter "Cursor Mode" by pressing the Cursor Mode button.</p>
    <p>You can also set the plot to have a peak hold. When this is turned on the
      highest value of each FFT bin is displayed until the "Peak Reset" button
      is pressed.</p>
    <h3>Cursor Mode</h3>
    <p><img alt="fft_cursor" src="images/2818_cursor_mode.JPG" height="240" width="401"
        border="0"></p>
    <p>When the user presses the Cursor Mode button the plugin will go full
      screen again and look as above. This allows the user to see the amplitude
      of different frequencies of the audio.</p>
    <p>There is a red dotted line that shows the currently selected frequency.
      The grey label at the top shows the value of this frequency and the - and
      + buttons allow the user to change this frequency. The user can also
      change this frequency by touching the screen.</p>
    <p>The label 2nd from right shows the amplitude of the selected frequency.</p>
    <p>Pressing the "Exit" button will exit from Cursor Mode.</p>
