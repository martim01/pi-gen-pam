A peak is defined as a frequency bin whose neighbours are both lower in amplitude than it.</li><li>THD - the Total Harmonic Distortion. This is worked out by <br /></li><ol><li>Calculating the power of the dominant frequency. </li><li>Calculating the power of each of the other frequency peaks and summing them</li><li>Taking the ratio of the 2. to 1. as a percentage</li></ol><li>Max - this is the maximum THD.</li><li>Max Time - this is the time the maximum THD was recorded.</li></ul>Pressing the Reset button will reset all the statisitics<br />
