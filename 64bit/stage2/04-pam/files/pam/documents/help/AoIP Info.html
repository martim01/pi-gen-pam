    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p><img alt="main" src="images/2824_main.JPG" height="240" width="404" border="0"></p>
    <p>The AoIP plugin shows information about any connected Audio Over IP
      session rather than the actual audio. Note if the selected input is
      Soundcard or File rather than RTP then this plugin will show some
      information about the selected input.</p>
    <p>The plugin does not go full screen so the <strong><span style="color: #33cccc">Screen
          Selection </span></strong>and <strong><span style="color: #33ccff">Option
          Selection</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #33cccc"></span></strong>
      buttons <strong><span style="color: #33ccff"></span></strong>are always
      visible.</p>
    <p>The plugin has 4 pages of information selectable by clicking on the Tabs
      at the top of the screen.</p>
    <h2>Session</h2>
    <p> Shows the overall Session details.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Input - the name of the connection as defined/discovered in the main
        AoIP Settings page. This will be empty if the input is not set to RTP</li>
      <li>Name - </li>
      <ul>
        <li>If the input is RTP this will show the name of the sesson as defined
          in the SDP</li>
        <li>If the input is Soundcard this will show the selected soundcard
          input</li>
        <li>If the input is File this will show the filename</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Type - the type of connection. </li>
      <ul>
        <li>If the input is RTP this will show either Mulitcast or Unicast.</li>
        <li>If the input is Soundcard this will say Soundcard</li>

      <li>Sync Type/Version/ID/Domain - Synchronization details</li>
      <li>Audio Subsessions - the number of audio subsessions that this Session
        contains</li>
      <li>Video Subsessions - the number of vide subsession this Session
        contains</li>
      <li>Duplicate Streams - SMPTE 2110 allows duplicate audio and video
        streams in a single session. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Active Subsession</h2>

        border="0"></p>
    <p>Shows information about the currently connected Subsession</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Source</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If the input is RTP this will show the IP address of the incoming
          audio. This may be a Unicast or Multicast address</li>
        <li>If the input is Soundcard this will show the selected soundcard
          input.</li>
        <li>If the input is File this will show the filename</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Codec - this will show the RTP audio codec. PAM can currently decode
        L24 (PCM 24 bit) and L16 (PCM 16 bit).</li>
      <li>Frequency - this is the sample rate of the incoming audio</li>
      <li>Channels - this is the number of channels in the incoming audio. PAM
        can currently cope with 0-8 channels.</li>
      <li>Id - this is the RTP id of the active subsession</li>
      <li>Sync Type/Version/Sync ID/Domain - Synchronization details.</li>
      <li>Sync Timestamp - all RTP frames have a 32 bit count in the header. The
        sync timestamp is the timestamp that the RTP frame count would be 0.</li>
      <li>Current Timestamp - this is the timestamp of the incoming RTP header.</li>
      <li>Transmission Time - this is the time that the incoming RTP header was
        transmitted from the sender.</li>
      <li>Presentation Time - this is the time that the incoming RTP header was
        received by PAM</li>
      <li>Network Latency - this is the difference between the Presentation Time
        and the Transmission Time.</li>
      <li>Display/Playback Time - this is the time that the audio was displayed
        on the screen and (if enabled) played out.</li>
      <li>Playback latency - this is the difference between the Display/Playback
        Time and the Presentation Time.</li>
      <li>Last Frame Size - this is the number of bytes received in the last RTP
        frame</li>
      <li>Last Frame Duration - this is the amount of audio (in time) received
        in the last RTP frame.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>QoS</h2>
    <img src="images/sessioninfo_qos.png" alt="" height="240" width="399" border="0">
    <p>Shows information about the quality of the incoming RTP stream. The QoS
      measurements are taken at preset intervals. The user can change the
      interval by selecting the Settings option page (see below).</p>
    <ul>

        running</li>
      <li>Total Packets Received - shows the total number of RTP packets
        received.</li>
      <li>Total Packets Lost - shows the total number of RTP packets lost.</li>
      <li>kBits/s Min - shows the minimum bitrate of the incoming RTP stream.</li>
      <li>kBits/s Average - shows the average bitrate of the incoming RTP
        stream.</li>
      <li>kBits/s Max - shows the maximum bitrate of the incoming RTP stream.</li>
      <li>Packets Lost/s Min - show the mnimum number of packets lost per
        second.</li>
      <li>Packets Lost/s Average - shows the average nunmber of packets lost per
        second.</li>
      <li>Packet Lost/s Max - show the maximum number of packets lost per
        second.</li>
      <li>Inter Packet Gap Min - shows the minumum amount of time between two
        adjacent packets being received.</li>
      <li>Inter Packet Gap Average - shows the average amount of time between
        two adjacent packets being received.</li>
      <li>Inter Packet Gap Max - shows the maximum amount of time between two
        adjacent packets being received.</li>
      <li>Jitter - shows the current variation in packet delay in ms.</li>
      <li>TS-DF - EBU 3337 Timestamp delay factor measurement.</li>
      <li>Current Graph - shows what the graph below is currently showing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Below the labels is a graph/histogram showing a history of the selected
      QoS measurement.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The graph moves from right to left. So the right of the graph is
        current time and the further to the left the further back in time.</li>
      <li>You can change the graph view between</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Line graph</li>
        <li>Bar chart</li>
        <li>Histogram</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/sessioninfo_histogram.png" alt="" height="240" width="399" border="0"></p>
    <p>The histogram view shows the number of times the data is within a
      specified range. This range can be changed by increasing/decreasing the
      granularity of the histogram.</p>
    <p>You can scroll the x-axis of the histogram by pressing on it and moving
      your finger left or right.</p>

    <h2>Raw SDP</h2>
    <p><img alt="sdp" src="images/2824_sdp.JPG" height="240" width="398" border="0">
    </p>
    <p>Shows the raw SDP description for the session as received by PAM. </p>
