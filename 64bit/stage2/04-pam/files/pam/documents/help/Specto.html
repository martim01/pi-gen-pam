    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p><img alt="main" src="images/2825_main.JPG" height="240" width="399" border="0"></p>
    <p>The Specto plugin shows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">Spectogram</a>
      of a channel of the incoming audio. The x-axis of the screen shows the
      frequencies of the audio, the y-axis shows time (lastest time at the
      bottom of the screen and going back in time towards the top). The colour
      of the dots on the screen shows the amplitude of the frequency at that
      point in time. </p>
    <p>The right hand side of the screen shows how the colours relate to the PPM
      scale.</p>
    <p>The blue labels at the bottom show</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Which channel is being analysed</li>
      <li>The windowing function</li>
      <li>The overlap between chunks of incoming audio</li>
      <li>The resolution of the spectogram.</li>
    </ul>
    Note the Spectogram will be paused if the page is not selected.<br>
    <h1>Options</h1>
    <h2>Routing</h2>
    <p><img alt="routing" src="images/2825_routing.JPG" height="240" width="401"
        border="0"></p>
    <p>The plugin shows the Spectogram for a single channel of audio. The
      Routing options page allows you to select which channel you wish to
      analyse.</p>
    <p>In stereo mode the user is also allowed to select</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Middle (L+R)</li>
      <li>Side (L-R)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The 1st blue label shows the current routing. </p>
    <h2>Window</h2>
    <p><img alt="window" src="images/2825_window.JPG" height="240" width="399" border="0"></p>
    <p>When performing spectrum analysis of live audio the incoming audio must
      be split in to chunks of data and each individually analysised. This can
      cause "spectral leakage". Therefore a windowing function is usually
      applied to the chunks of audio to smooth the edges of each window. There
      are a number of different windowing functions available, all of which give
      slightly different characteristics to the resultant frequency response.
      See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function">here </a>
      for more information.</p>
    <p>The 2nd blue label shows the current windowing function. </p>
    <h2>Overlap</h2>
    <p><img alt="overlap" src="images/2825_overlap.JPG" height="240" width="399" border="0"></p>
    <p>Another way of making the spectrum analysis more accurate when dealing
      with chunks of live audio is by overlapping each chunk of audio. This page
      allows the user to decide how much he wants this overlap to be.</p>
    <p>The 3rd blue label shows the amount of overlap. </p>
    <h2>Bins</h2>
    <p><img alt="bins" src="images/2825_bins.JPG" height="240" width="403" border="0"></p>
    <p>When performing an FFT on audio the result is split in to a number of
      "bins" each a certain frequency wide. The more bins that you use the
      narrower each <span style="cursor: help; color: #4444ff">bin</span> and
      hence the better the frequency resolution. However more bins means that
      you need to read in more audio before you can perform the FFT and so the
      refresh rate is slower. This page allows the user to choose the frequency
      resolution he wants.</p>
    <p>As the Spectogram always plots 1 dot per bin more bins means better
      resolution but a lower frequency cutoff point.</p>
    <p>The 4th blue label shows the current resolution. </p>
    <h2>HeatMap </h2>
    <p><img alt="heatmap" src="images/2825_heatmap.JPG" height="240" width="399" border="0"></p>
    <p>The HeatMap Option page allows the user to decide what colours should map
      to what frequency amplitudes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mono - from black (no signal) to white (full level signal)</li>
      <li>Blue-Red - from Blue (no signal) to Red (full level signal)</li>
      <li>BCGYR - Blue, Cyan, Green, Yellow, Red</li>
      <li>PPM - as BCGYR but mapping the Green colours to PPM4</li>
      <li>BlBCGYRWh - Black, Blue, Cyan, Green, Yellow, Red, White</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Options</h2>
    <p><img src="images/specto_options.png" alt="" height="240" width="399" border="0"></p>
    <p>The Options page allows the user to decide whether the x-axis of the
      spectogram should be linear (equal space between frequencies) or
      logarithmic.</p>
    <p>If logarithmic the whole frequency spectrum is displayed. If linear up to
      about 17kHz is displayed.</p>
